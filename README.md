## Module Eight Journal Reflection

**1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements**
The Gaming Room needed help expanding their multiplayer game, Draw It or Lose It, so it could work on multiple platforms. They wanted it to be scalable, secure, and able to handle a bunch of users while still running smooth. My goal was to come up with a design that supported all of that without overcomplicating things.

**2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation**
I think I explained everything in a way that actually makes sense. I didn't just list technical terms. I made sure to connect each design choice to something that would actually help the game work better. That helped keep it realistic and easy to follow.

**3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code** 
Even though we didn't write full code, planning everything oout helped a lot more. It made me really think through how the app would be structed and how each part needs to work together. That kind of planning makes coding way easier down the line.

**4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick and how would you improve it** 
If I had to improve something, I'd probably go back to the storage selection and break things down more. I would explain how image files and session data should be organized separately. I'd also throw in a diagram if I had more time.

**5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design and why is it important to consider the user’s needs when designing** 
I based a lot of my design on how players would actually use the app. That's why I kept it lightweight and focused on keeping things fast and stable. If users have a bad experience, the rest of the project doesn't really matter. Keeping them in mind makes the whole design better.

**6. How did you approach designing software and what techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application**
I started by understanding what the client actually needed and used that as the foundation. Then I focused on building something that would still work long-term if the app grows. In the future I'd get feedback from others earlier and maybe work more as a team so I can catch anything I missed.
